# CyberSecurity-ZAP-Project
Web Application Vulnerability Assessment using OWASP ZAP

## Aim
To perform vulnerability assessment of a web application using OWASP ZAP and identify common security issues.

## Objectives
- Understand web application security concepts
- Perform automated security scanning using OWASP ZAP
- Identify vulnerabilities and security risks
- Provide mitigation and security recommendations

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Kali Linux
- OWASP ZAP
- Web Browser (Firefox)

## Theory
### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized modification
- **Availability**: Ensure systems and data are accessible when required

### Attack Surface
The attack surface represents all possible entry points through which an attacker can exploit a system.

## Methodology
1. Installed and configured OWASP ZAP
2. Launched target web application
3. Performed spider scan to discover URLs
4. Executed active vulnerability scanning
5. Analyzed alerts and vulnerabilities
6. Generated final ZAP security report

## Vulnerabilities Identified
- Missing Security Headers
- Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
- Information Disclosure
- Weak Security Configuration

## Recommendations
- Implement proper HTTP security headers
- Use secure authentication mechanisms
- Regularly perform vulnerability scanning
- Keep software and dependencies updated

## Result
The web application was successfully scanned using OWASP ZAP and multiple vulnerabilities were identified along with security recommendations.

## Conclusion
OWASP ZAP is an effective open-source tool for identifying web application vulnerabilities and improving overall security posture.
